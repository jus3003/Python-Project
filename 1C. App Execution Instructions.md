# **Running The App**

In order to run the app, we have two provided two options. Both options are separately placed in folders in the main branch: 

<ol>
 <li>"Option 1 - Run Executable File"</li>
 <li>"Option 2 - Run Code"</li>
</ol> 
Simply download the folder of the desired option and follow the instructions for each option below.


# **Option 1: Executable File (Preferred)**
This option is preferred for TA/professor evaluation because there is no need for the evaluator to download any software, packages, or configure their virtual environment. The app was packaged into an executable file using the Python package ***PyInstaller***. A guide on how the executable file was created is provided in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEko7jWYKiE&ab_channel=Codemy.com. 

To find the executable file, navigate the following path on the main branch: ***Python-Project\Option 1 - Run Executable File\dist\App***. The app file is named **App.exe**. Opening this file will run the application. 


# **Option 2: Run The Code**

To run the app directly through the Python file and IDE, download the entire folder and load the folder into your IDE. Then follow the steps outlined below:


## 1. **Download Packages & Configure Virtual Environment**

### **Requests**
Requests is an HTTP library package used to send HTTP requests via python to extract information from websites and databases. *This package was used to extract the modulus of elasticity of materials and price data from an online database*. To install Requests, use the following installation code: 

```
pip install requests
```
### **Numpy/Pandas**
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

*Numpy and Pandas was used to organize and manipulate data extracted from the material and price databases*. To install Numpy and Pandas, use the following installation code: 

```
pip install numpy
pip install numpy
```

### **Matplotlib**
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. *Numpy was used to graph the historical price data of materials*. To install Matplotlib, use the following installation code:

```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

### **Kivy**
Kivy is a free and open source Python framework for developing mobile apps and other multitouch application software with a natural user interface. *Kivy was used to develop the GUI in our app to display the calculator, material information, and beam deflection results*. To install kivy, use the installation code below. More detailed setup options to configure different environment/desktop setups can be found in the following webpage: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html. 

```
python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivy_examples
```

## 2. Kivy Design File (.kv) and Graphics (.png & .jpeg)
Ensure that the Kivy design file and the graphics are within the same file directory as the Python file. The Kivy design file is referenced by name in the Python file to be executed. If the app or GUI does not execute properly, ensure the naming conventions in the source files or the file reference in the code has not been tampered with. 

## 3. Run Application in IDE
Run the application in the IDE and a KIVY popup window with the app should be displayed. Enjoy!
