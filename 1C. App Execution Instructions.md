# Running The App

In order to run the app, we have two provided two options. Both options are separately placed in folders in the main branch: 

<ol>
 <li>"Option 1 - Run Executable File"</li>
 <li>"Option 2 - Run Code"</li>
</ol> 
Simply download the folder of the option desired, load the folder in your terminal, and follow the instructions for each option below.

## Option 1: Executable File (Preferred)
This option is preferred for TA/professor evaluation because there is no need for the evaluator to download any software, packages, or configure their virtual environment. The app was packaged into an executable file using the Python package ***PyInstaller***. A guide on how the executable file was created is provided in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEko7jWYKiE&ab_channel=Codemy.com. 

To find the executable file, navigate the following path on the main branch: ***Python-Project\Option 1 - Run Executable File\dist\App***. The app file is named **App.exe**. Opening this file will run the application.
