App: A basic beam analysis software to help structural engineers get beam deflections
Packages: numpy, Kivy, pandas, beautifulsoup4
 
## Beam Deflection App
  
  Beam analysis is commonly used to determine the structural integrity of an engineering design. Creating an app to assist in engineering design will make the design process easier for students. The information below shows the breakdown of how our app was made. There were three main components to our app: calculator, GUI, and materials database. For the calculator, discussed in the beam deflection section below, the primary package used was numpy. If the user wishes to add different deflection cases (such as more complex loads) they should refer to the textbook in the link in the overview. For current material properties, we pulled values from an online database using the packages pandas and beautifulsoup4. As the database is updated overtime, there will be no need to adjust code for material properties. The GUI was made using the package kivy. Once the code is run, the user will only interact with the user interface. All values that the user selects will automatically be placed in the calculator. 

## Packages

To calculate the deflection and angle, the python package numpy was used. Numpy is a package that allows to use math functions, like the square-root. To install numpy into anaconda, copy and paste the code below:
conda install -c anaconda numpy

## Beam Deflection Equations

### Overview:

  Code for beam deflection is based off of the textbook: Mechanics of Materials - 9th edition (amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Mechanics-Materials-Barry-J-Goodno/dp/1337093343) and can be found in the Calculator Function.py file in the Supporting Materials folder. The deflection, commonly denotated as v, is the displacement in the y direction of any location on a beam. Analysis of beams is seen in multiple classes in many fields of engineering. Knowing the deflection and angles allow engineers to make vital design and material decisions for a structural design. Beam deflection is dependent of the dimensions of the beam, the elastic modulus of the material of the beam, and the type of load on the beam. We used two different beam support layouts to show the capacity of our application. Further development of this app could include other types of supports. A single function (classed BD) is written for beam deflection.
  
### Dimensions: 
  
  Dimensions include: total length of beam (L), location of load (A), radius (R) - only if the cross-section is a circle, length of base (B) - only if the cross-section is a square, and height (H) - only if the cross-section is a square. These are the first 5 inputs for the BD function. 
  If a user wants a circular cross-section instead of a square, then a 0 will be placed for the B and H values. Same can be said if a user wants a square cross-section, then the R value would be 0. Now that the cross-section is determined, the first thing the function will calculate is the moment of inertia. Separate functions are included at the top of beam_deflection.py to show the moment of inertia calculations. In the finalized code, moment of inertia is included in the BD function. Moment of intertia is denotated as MoI in the BD function. 
  Both L and A have to be given or the code will not work. For example, if the load is located at the end of the beam, then the value of A would be equal to L. Important note, for the distributive load (q), the value for A indicates that q is going from the left end of the beam (L=0) to the A location. If a user wants to have a distibutive load not start at the left, they will have to calculate the difference by hand. Questions regarding how to do this are addressed in Chapter 9 of the textbook above. 
  
### Loads:

  Load includes: distributive (q), point (P), and moment (Mo). 
  User decides what type of load and the value of the load in the app. If they do not like the final deflection results, they can hit the back button and adjust inputs. Units of force are in Newtons (N) and distances are in meters (m). Examples can be seen in the textbook. How the function BD works, is if the user selects q, then Mo=0 and P=0. After determining the type of load, the loop containing the conditional will calculate the deflection and angle based on the formulas in Appendix H of the textbook.
  
### Supports:

  There are two types of support cases in the app. The first type is a left fixed support and no support on the right. This would mean that the max deflection happens at the right end of the beam (where no support is located). The angle would be located at the left end of the support. The second type is a left pin support and right roller support. location of deflection is typically located where the load occurs (A). Angles are given for both the right and left end for this support system. Diagrams are present in this GITHUB and in the scanned textbook pages.

## Material Properties:
 
  The elastic modulus (E) is a material property used in the beam deflection equations. Materials with higher elastic modulus have a smaller deflection. If a user does not have a load on the beam, they can calculate the expected q value related to the weight of the beam. Using this q value they can see what would naturally happen over time with the beam without a load. If a user wants to combine the weight of the beam in the final deflection calcuation, they will have to follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 9.
  
  Since material properties such as the elastic modulus are constantly being studied, the values tend to be updated for different materials as new experimental results show new findings.  With this being said, we want to use the most up to date E values in order for our calculator to be as accurate as possible.  To do this we found a table online at https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/young-modulus-d_417.html that constantly updates the E values for a wide variety of materials.  Using beautifulsoup requests, we were able to scrap the data from the table and store the materials along with their E values in a pandas DataFrame.  We then made a function in which the user inputs what material they would like to use and the E value associated with that material is pulled and converted into the correct units needed for the beam deflection calculations.
