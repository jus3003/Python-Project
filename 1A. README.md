App: A basic beam analysis software to help structural engineers get beam deflections
Packages: numpy, Kivy, pandas, beautifulsoup4, Matplotlib, requests
 
# **Beam Deflection App**
  
  Beam analysis is commonly used to determine the structural integrity of an engineering design. Creating an app to assist in engineering design will make the design process easier for students. The information below shows the breakdown of how our app was made. There were three main components to our app: calculator, GUI, and materials database. For the calculator, discussed in the beam deflection section below, the primary package used was numpy. If the user wishes to add different deflection cases (such as more complex loads) they should refer to the textbook in the link in the overview. For current material properties, we pulled values from an online database using the packages pandas and beautifulsoup4. As the database is updated overtime, there will be no need to adjust code for material properties. The GUI was made using the package kivy. Once the code is run, the user will only interact with the user interface. All values that the user selects will automatically be placed in the calculator.

# **General App Architecture**
The overall App architecture consists of four main parts: 

<ol>
 <li>Input Beam Deflection Variables in Kivy GUI</li>
 <li>Extract Beam Material Properties from Database (Data Pull Function Folder)</li>
 <li>Run Beam Deflection Calculations in Calculator (Calculator Function Folder)</li>
 <li>Display Results in Kivy GUI
</ol> 

A visual representation of our App architecture in the form of a slide deck is attached in the main branch under the file ***"1B. Project Architecture.pdf"***.

## **1. Input Variables**

### **Overview:**

  Code for beam deflection is based off of the textbook: Mechanics of Materials - 9th edition (Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Mechanics-Materials-Barry-J-Goodno/dp/1337093343) and can be found in the Calculator Function.py file in the Supporting Materials folder. The deflection, commonly denotated as v, is the displacement in the y direction of any location on a beam. Analysis of beams is seen in multiple classes in many fields of engineering. Knowing the deflection and angles allow engineers to make vital design and material decisions for a structural design. Beam deflection is dependent of the dimensions of the beam, the elastic modulus of the material of the beam, and the type of load on the beam. We used two different beam support layouts to show the capacity of our application. Further development of this app could include other types of supports. A single function (classed BD) is written for beam deflection. For more information on the code please look at the calculator folder.
  
### **Dimensions:**
  
  Dimensions include: total length of beam (L), location of load (A), radius (R) - only if the cross-section is a circle, length of base (B) - only if the cross-section is a square, and height (H) - only if the cross-section is a square. These are the first 5 inputs for the BD function. 
  If a user wants a circular cross-section instead of a square, then a 0 will be placed for the B and H values. Same can be said if a user wants a square cross-section, then the R value would be 0. Now that the cross-section is determined, the first thing the function will calculate is the moment of inertia. Separate functions are included at the top of beam_deflection.py to show the moment of inertia calculations. In the finalized code, moment of inertia is included in the BD function. Moment of intertia is denotated as MoI in the BD function. 
  Both L and A have to be given or the code will not work. For example, if the load is located at the end of the beam, then the value of A would be equal to L. Important note, for the distributive load (q), the value for A indicates that q is going from the left end of the beam (L=0) to the A location. If a user wants to have a distibutive load not start at the left, they will have to calculate the difference by hand. Questions regarding how to do this are addressed in Chapter 9 of the textbook above. 
  
### **Loads:**

  Load includes: distributive (q), point (P), and moment (Mo). 
  User decides what type of load and the value of the load in the app. If they do not like the final deflection results, they can hit the back button and adjust inputs. Units of force are in Newtons (N) and distances are in meters (m). Examples can be seen in the textbook. How the function BD works, is if the user selects q, then Mo=0 and P=0. After determining the type of load, the loop containing the conditional will calculate the deflection and angle based on the formulas in Appendix H of the textbook.
  
### **Supports:**

  There are two types of support cases in the app. The first type is a left fixed support and no support on the right. This would mean that the max deflection happens at the right end of the beam (where no support is located). The angle would be located at the left end of the support. The second type is a left pin support and right roller support. Location of deflection is typically located where the load occurs (A). Angles are given for both the right and left end for this support system. Diagrams are present in this GITHUB and in the scanned textbook pages.

## **2. Extract Properties from Databse**
 
  The elastic modulus (E) is a material property used in the beam deflection equations. Materials with higher elastic modulus have a smaller deflection. If a user does not have a load on the beam, they can calculate the expected q value related to the weight of the beam. Using this q value they can see what would naturally happen over time with the beam without a load. If a user wants to combine the weight of the beam in the final deflection calcuation, they will have to follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 9.
  
  Since material properties such as the elastic modulus are constantly being studied, the values tend to be updated for different materials as new experimental results show new findings.  With this being said, we want to use the most up to date E values in order for our calculator to be as accurate as possible.  To do this we found a table online at https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/young-modulus-d_417.html that constantly updates the E values for a wide variety of materials.  Using beautifulsoup requests, we were able to scrape the data from the table and store the materials along with their E values in a pandas DataFrame.  We then made a function in which the user inputs what material they would like to use and the E value associated with that material is pulled and converted into the correct units needed for the beam deflection calculations.

  The simplified process for database extraction is accomplished in Python using the following code:

  ```
  url = 'https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/young-modulus-d_417.html'
  html = requests.get(url).content
  df_list = pd.read_html(html)
  df = df_list[-1]
  df.to_csv('MaterialProperties.csv')
  df.columns = ['Material', 'YM', 'UTS', 'YS']  
  ```
  
## **3. Beam Deflection Calculations**
The calculator algorithm computes the maximum deflection and angles of rotation from the netural axis of the beam based on the inputs and theory of beam deflection outlined in **Section 1**. Provided below is a snippet of the calculator function used: 

```
def BD(R,B,H,L,A,support,q,P,Mo,E):

  if support == 'fix':
    if q != 0:
      deflection = (4*L-A)*(q*A**3) /(24*E*MoI)
      angle = (q*A**3)/(6*E*MoI)

    if P != 0:
      deflection = (3*L-A)*(P*A**2)/(6*E*MoI)
      angle = (P*A**2)/(2*E*MoI)
```
# **Front-End**
## **4. Kivy GUI**

### **Create App Screens**

The App windows were created using a class setup. A class was created for each window in the Python file and a main app class was created with reference to the Kivy Design file for the GUI. Kivy allows for all the widgets (i.e. buttons, labels, and input boxes) to be written using the kivy design language. Using the kivy language allows for the separation of the design elements and the logic of the application. This is especially useful when the application has a large number of widgets and widget trees. 

A .py file calls the widgets. A separate .kv file contains all the design elements defining the widgets, including size, color, shape, and placement. The .kv file must be named the same as the name of the main class and be located in the same directory.

*Python File:*
```
class WindowManager(ScreenManager):

class ConnectionWindow(Screen):
class VariablesWindow (Screen):
class OutputWindow (Screen):

kv = Builder.load_file("my.kv")
class MainApp (App):
    def build (self):
        Window.clearcolor = (51/255,63/255,72/255,0.34/255)
        return kv
```
*Kivy File:*
```
WindowManager:
    ConnectionWindow:
    VariablesWindow:
    OutputWindow:
```

### **Create Screen UI**

A sample for a screen page design is shown below. As mentioned previously, all the design elements are in the .kv file and all the logic is in the .py file.

*Kv File*
```
<OutputWindow>:
    name: "output"
    id: output

    FloatLayout: 

        Button:
            size_hint: 1, 0.2
            pos_hint: {"top": 1}
            id: error_checker
            text: "Calculation Successful"
            font_size: self.width/20

        GridLayout:
            size_hint: 0.8, 0.25
            pos_hint: {"top": 0.75, "center_x": 0.5}
            rows: 1
            cols: 1
            
            Image:
                source: root.manager.connection_deflection
                allow_stretch: True
                keep_ratio: True

        GridLayout:
            size_hint: 0.8, 0.4
            pos_hint: {"bottom": 0.8, "right": 0.9}

            rows: 3
            cols: 2

            Label: 
                text: "Left Angle (rad)"
            Button:
                id: angle_left_label
                text: "angle left label"
                font_size: self.width/10
            Label: 
                text: "Right Angle (rad)"    
            Button:
                id: angle_right_label
                text: "angle right label"
                font_size: self.width/10
            Label: 
                text: "Deflection (m)"    
            Button:
                id: deflection_label
                text: "deflection label"
                font_size: self.width/10

        Button: 
            size_hint: 0.1, 0.1
            pos_hint: {"left": 1, "bottom": 0} 
            text: "Back" 
            on_release:
                app.root.current = "variables"
                root.manager.transition.direction = "left"
```


*Python File*
```
class OutputWindow (Screen):
 
    def output_pass(self):
        print("angle_left =", round(output_list [0],4))
        print("angle_right =", round(output_list [1],4))
        print("deflection =", round(output_list [2],4)) 
```
All the elements of the application were compiled using the Builder. Since Builder is a global Kivy instance, all the results were saved in a global list to be outputed by the functions.
